## Problem
Retail and eCommerce businesses constantly struggle to balance inventory. Ordering too much leads to losses, while ordering too little means missed sales. Traditional forecasting methods like Excel or intuition are often inaccurate, especially for fast-moving products with seasonal demand. This leads to poor inventory decisions, reduced profit margins, and dissatisfied customers. In today’s competitive market, data-driven sales forecasting is no longer optional it’s a necessity.
